## Dependencies

### Back End Dependencies
*  This app's functionality depends on Firebase, nodeJS, expressJS;
  *  **[Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/)** - This framework helps in creation of  database and user authentication.
  *  **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)** - Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
  *  **[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)** - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. I used this framework for routing.


## Front End Dependencies
